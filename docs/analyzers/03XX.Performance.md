## INTL0301
### Favor using the method `EnumerateFiles` over the `GetFiles` method.

When using the `System.IO.Directory` class, it is suggested to use the `EnumerateFiles` static method
instead of the `GetFiles` method.  In the remarks section of the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.directory.enumeratefiles), it is stated that using the `EnumerateFiles` method is more efficient because you can start enumerating the collection before all the results are returned:

 > The EnumerateFiles and GetFiles methods differ as follows: When you use EnumerateFiles, you can start enumerating the       
 > collection of names before the whole collection is returned; when you use GetFiles, you must wait for the whole array of 
 > names to be returned before you can access the array. Therefore, when you are working with many files and directories, 
 > EnumerateFiles can be more efficient.
 > The returned collection is not cached; each call to the GetEnumerator on the collection will start a new enumeration.
