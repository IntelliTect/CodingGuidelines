### Async Void

Async methods must return either `Task` or `Task<T>`. 

**Allowed**
```c#
public async void SomeTopLevelMethod(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // some code
}

public async Task SomeMethod()
{
    // some code
}
```
**Disallowed**
```c#
public async void SomeMethod()
{
    // some code
}
```

### When to suppress

The only acceptable use of `async void` is in a top level methods, such as event handlers. For these cases it is safe to suppress this warning. In all other cases, this warning should **NOT** be suppressed.
