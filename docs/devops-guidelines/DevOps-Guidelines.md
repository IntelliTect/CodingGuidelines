A complete DevOps approach combines critial develop, operations and management concerns so that software projects can continously and consistently deliver high quality solutions. 

Each practice within these guidelines works with others to form a working model for continous improvement. In addition, DevOps works hand in hand with portfolio and project management and agile initiatives.

This wiki is intended for the practitioners: team members on projects. It  provides a set of guidelines that can be used as a starting point for any project's DevOps implementation. Each project will need to define specific tools and processes that will work best for that project. This wiki can be cloned and used as a starting point for a project specific DevOps Strategy.
