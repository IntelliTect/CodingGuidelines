**Incident Management**

Incidents are defects found after a feature has rolled out to production. 

Once a feature has been productionized (Ring 5), any issue found will be logged in the ServiceNow incident tracking system. Service delivery groups will be defined in Service Now that will immediately notify the appropriate DCX project/support team of reported issue.

Service Delivery groups will contain the name(s) of specific personnel assigned to address issues in various areas of the overall DCX solution (UI, CMS, Integration etc.)

Incidents logged in ServiceNow will default to the current escalation process for all incidents in ServiceNow.

For Bizlink external customers, the Global Marketing help desk will continue to log cases in Salesforce, however any technical issues will be logged in ServiceNow as is their current practice.

DCX project will work with the Service Now team on exposing an API to the new DCX solution, where external customers will have the option of submitting issues directly to Phillips 66. The ServiceNow tickets will be directed to either the Global Marketing help desk or the Lubes Customer Excellence team for review.
