Azure Pipelines is a cloud service that you can use to automatically build and **TEST** your code project and make it available to other users. 

Below are key guides for developers on testing using Azure Pipeline related to **testing**

[Review test results](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/review-continuous-test-results-after-build?view=azure-devops)
Test reports provide an effective and consistent way to view the tests results executed using different test frameworks, in order to measure pipeline quality, review traceability, troubleshoot failures and drive failure ownership.

[Analyze test results](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/test-analytics?view=azure-devops)
Tracking test quality over time and improving test collateral is key to maintaining a healthy DevOps pipeline. Test analytics provides near real-time visibility into your test data for builds and releases. It helps improve the efficiency of your pipeline by identifying repetitive, high impact quality issues.

[Review code coverage!](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/test/review-code-coverage-results?view=azure-devops)
Code coverage helps you determine the proportion of your project's code that is actually being tested by tests such as unit tests. To increase your confidence of the code changes, and guard effectively against bugs, your tests should exercise - or cover - a large proportion of your code.

Reviewing the code coverage result helps to identify code path(s) that are not covered by the tests. This information is important to improve the test collateral over time by reducing the test debt.
